# large_scale_genomic_alignment_extraction
A scalable large scale genomic fraction aligner and extractor that uses numba for the large scale alignment of the genomes and the transcriptomes and process them over the cores for the extraction of the aligned regions. The aligned regions can also be mapped to the length plotter and can be machine trained for specific applications
